This is a simple example extension for the [NxT](https://github.com/NxTCrew/NxTBase) ecosystem.

## Installation

1. Install the [NxT](https://github.com/NxTCrew/NxTBase) base plugin.
2. Drop the `OneChunkTycoon.jar` into your `plugins/NxT/extensions` folder.
3. Restart your server or run `/extensions reload` to load the extension.

## Usage

This extension adds a new world generator, the `OneChunkTycoon` generator.
In this world, every player gets one single chunk with a small spawn area.
In this area, there are a few pressure plates, which can be used to buy new buildings and machines.
Each building or machine has a price, which is deducted from the player's balance.
For each building or machine the player owns, he gets a small income every few seconds.
